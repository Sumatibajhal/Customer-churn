# Customer-churn
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the project identifies customers likely to leave the service and provides insights into the most significant factors contributing to churn.

Features
Preprocessing:

Handles missing values (mean strategy for numeric data, mode strategy for categorical data).

Encodes categorical variables using label encoding.

Machine Learning:

Implements a Random Forest Classifier for churn prediction.

Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Analyzes feature importance to identify key contributors to churn.

Web Application:

A user-friendly interface built using Flask and Bootstrap.

Allows users to input customer data and receive churn predictions.

Technologies Used
Python

pandas, numpy (data manipulation)

scikit-learn (machine learning)

Flask (backend web framework)

HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
